# MachineMancala

This is a project with the purpose of introducing a model that can learn how to play Mancala over time and get better at it. The code runs in python as a .py program and is currently under development :)

## Development

In order to make this run, create a fork (for independent development), or a branch as needed. Make sure to not merge with Main until changes are correct and operational

### Prerequisites

First off, make sure you install python in your local machine // development environment. Keep in mind that as the project progresses more dependencies may be needed. Consult pertinent documentation for your OS instructions, or ask around!

Next, make sure to clone this repo locally:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/MrYland3r/MachineMancala.git
```

Afterwards, install the following python libraries: (update over time)

- 1
- 2
